// What does the “unsafe” mean in the context of Rust? In short - no segfaults. 
// In Rust it is unsafe to dereference a raw pointer or call a non-rust function. 
// OpenGL is non-rust, so we will have lots of unsafe fun.

// Why “unsafe” exists
// It may seem strange that “unsafe” exists at all. 
// The reason for it is quite simple: it allows us to deal with complicated stuff once, inside a function with a safe API, 
// and then completely forget about it when we become the users of that API. 
// In other words, it moves the responsibility of correct API usage to API implementer.

On windows Rust is available with two toolchains: GNU (compatible with mingw C libraries), and MSVC (compatible with Microsoft C++ C libraries). 
We will use MSVC toolchain.

Install the MSVC toolchain using rustup (may be already installed):
rustup install stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

rustup default stable-msvc





A window
To create a window that works across multiple platforms, 
as well as provides such niceties as OpenGL context or multi-platform input, 
we will use SDL2.


The SDL context type. Initialize with sdl2::init().

From a thread-safety perspective, Sdl represents the main thread. 
As such, Sdl is a useful type for ensuring that SDL types 
that can only be used on the main thread are initialized that way.


The init function signature is pub fn init() -> Result<Sdl, String>, it returns Result<Sdl, String>. 

If initialization was successful, the Result contains Sdl struct as an Ok value, 
otherwise it contains the String as Err value.

Notice that there is no explicit SDL_Quit(), but it is still executed automatically at the end of the fn main.

Rust language does not have garbage collector, instead variables are cleaned up as they leave scopes. 
Sdl struct has a drop function that is executed before the clean up, and that’s where the SDL_Quit() is invoked.

The story is not complete here however, because Sdl is secretly internally reference-counted. 
Therefore you need not to concern yourself of keeping it around, it will keep SDL alive as long as any other sdl object has a clone of it.


had to install apt-get install xorg-dev
or else got no video driver error (wsl2 - ubuntu)
